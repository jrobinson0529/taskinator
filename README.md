### Features
- Taskinator features its own API using ASP.NET Core and T-SQL for the database.
- The main page will display twelve random robots for users to see a sample of what is available on our site.
- A non-logged in user is able to view robots and browse for potential purchases.
- A user is able to authenticate via google Oauth by logging in to the page via a ***Login*** button in the nav bar.
- An authenticated user is able to view their own profile, make changes on it, and even delete it.
- An authenticated use is able to view their cart and add products (robots) to their cart, remove products from their cart, and update the days they would like to rent a robot.
- When the user is ready to complete an order they can proceed to check out choosing a payment method and confirming the order.
